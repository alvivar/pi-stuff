# Pi-Link Coordination

How to coordinate work across Pi terminals via pi-link.

---

## Tool Selection Rule

- Need the answer back now? → `link_prompt`
- Need autonomous work done? → `link_send(triggerTurn: true)`
- Need to notify only? → `link_send(triggerTurn: false)`

---

## The Golden Rule

> After `link_send(triggerTurn: true)` to terminal X, do not `link_prompt` X until X sends a completion callback.

Pick one mode per terminal per task. Mixing sync and async on the same terminal is the most common coordination failure.

---

## The Tools

### `link_list`
Returns connected terminals with names, live status (`idle`, `thinking`, `tool:<name>`), and working directory (cwd). Use before delegating when availability or path context is uncertain.

### `link_prompt`
Synchronous RPC. Send a prompt, wait for the response.

- Fails immediately if target is missing, self, disconnects, or busy (local work or another remote prompt)
- 90s inactivity timeout, 30min hard ceiling
- Remote agent doesn't share your context — prompts must be self-contained
- Include: goal, scope, constraints, output format, done condition

### `link_send`
Fire-and-forget. Send to one terminal or `to: "*"` to broadcast (excludes sender).

Set `triggerTurn: true` to activate the receiver's LLM. The sender does **not** get the response back.

**Callback contract for `triggerTurn: true`:** ask the receiver to reply via `link_send` with:
- `DONE` signal
- Output paths / artifacts created
- Blockers or open questions

---

## Operating Constraints

- **One remote prompt at a time per target.** Concurrent requests rejected as busy.
- **No shared context.** Every remote prompt must be self-contained.
- **Messages are ephemeral.** Offline terminals lose messages.
- **Localhost only.** Same machine.
- **Cwd is a hint, not proof.** Same cwd ≠ same workspace/branch/access. Use explicit paths; absolute when cwds differ or shared-root assumptions are unclear.
- **Naming:** `role@domain` (e.g., `builder@pi-link`). Only talk to your own domain unless told otherwise.

---

## Coordination Modes

### Sync ask — `link_prompt`
For answers, review, analysis you need back now. One terminal at a time. Keep scope focused to avoid timeout.

### Async delegate — `link_send(triggerTurn: true)`
For autonomous work. Require the callback contract (DONE + paths + blockers). Do your own work in parallel. Don't `link_prompt` the target until the callback arrives.

### Parallel batch — async to multiple terminals
Distribute independent tasks. Use explicit paths (absolute if cwds differ). Wait for all callbacks, then synthesize. Don't prompt any dispatched terminal until its callback arrives.

---

## Anti-Patterns

**❌ Mixing async and sync on the same terminal**
Dispatched with `link_send(triggerTurn: true)` then sent a `link_prompt` → rejected as busy. See Golden Rule.

**❌ Using `link_send` when you need the response**
Result disappears. Use `link_prompt`.

**❌ Vague prompts**
"Fix the bug" is useless. Include file, line, root cause, expected fix.

**❌ No completion callback on async work**
Always require DONE + artifact paths + blockers.

**❌ Circular delegation**
A → B → C → A = deadlock. Maintain clear hierarchy.

**❌ Skipping `link_list` before retrying a busy target**
Check status before re-sending.

## Quick Reference

| I need to...                     | Tool                            | Mode            |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------- |
| See who's available              | `link_list`                     | —               |
| Get an answer from another agent | `link_prompt`                   | Synchronous     |
| Delegate autonomous work         | `link_send(triggerTurn: true)`  | Asynchronous    |
| Notify without activating        | `link_send(triggerTurn: false)` | Fire-and-forget |
| Broadcast to all                 | `link_send(to: "*")`            | Broadcast       |
