# pi-mesh

A WebSocket-based inter-terminal communication system that creates a local network between multiple Pi coding agent terminals. Enables terminals to discover each other, exchange messages, and orchestrate work across agents — all automatically on `localhost`.

> Self-contained TypeScript in a single `index.ts` file. No configuration required.

## Why?

A single Pi terminal is powerful. Multiple terminals working together unlock new patterns:

- **Research + Build** — one terminal investigates APIs, docs, or logs while another writes code based on the findings.
- **Fan-out** — split a large task across agents (e.g., "terminal A handles the backend, terminal B handles the frontend") and collect results.
- **Orchestrator / Worker** — designate one terminal as a coordinator that delegates subtasks to others via `mesh_prompt` and assembles the final output.
- **Review pipeline** — one terminal writes code, another reviews it, back and forth until both are satisfied.

---

## Prerequisites

- [Pi coding agent](https://github.com/nicholasgasior/pi-coding-agent) installed and working
- Node.js (LTS recommended)

---

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
pi install git:github.com/alvivar/pi-mesh
```

### Uninstall

```bash
pi uninstall git:github.com/alvivar/pi-mesh
```

### Usage

Start two or more `pi` terminals — they discover each other automatically:

```
Terminal 1                            Terminal 2
----------                            ----------
$ pi                                  $ pi
✓ Mesh hub on :9900 as "t-a1b2"      ✓ Joined mesh as "t-c3d4" (2 online)
```

Use `/mesh` in any terminal to check status, or let the LLM tools handle cross-terminal coordination.

---

## Walkthrough

Here's a concrete example of two terminals collaborating. Open two separate `pi` sessions.

**Terminal 1** — rename and check status:

```
> /mesh-name builder
✓ Renamed to "builder"

> /mesh
⚡ Mesh: "builder" (hub) · 2 terminals online: builder, researcher
```

**Terminal 2** — rename it too:

```
> /mesh-name researcher
✓ Reconnecting as "researcher" (hub may assign a different name if taken)...
```

**Now ask Terminal 1's LLM to delegate work:**

In Terminal 1, type a normal prompt:

```
> Use mesh_prompt to ask "researcher" to summarize the contents of README.md in this directory
```

The LLM in Terminal 1 calls `mesh_prompt` → Terminal 2's LLM receives the prompt, reads the file, and sends back a summary → Terminal 1's LLM presents the result to you.

**Or broadcast a message to all terminals:**

```
> /mesh-broadcast starting the deployment pipeline
✓ Broadcast sent
```

Every other terminal sees:

```
⚡ [builder] starting the deployment pipeline
```

---

## Configuration

No configuration required. The extension auto-discovers other terminals on `127.0.0.1:9900`. See [Limitations](#limitations--design-decisions) for details on the hardcoded port.

---

## LLM Tools

The extension registers three tools that the LLM can invoke during agent runs.

### Which tool should I use?

| Tool          | Behavior                                             | Returns                                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `mesh_send`   | Send a message; optionally trigger the remote LLM    | Send/delivery status only                |
| `mesh_prompt` | Run a prompt on a remote terminal and wait for reply | The remote terminal's assistant response |
| `mesh_list`   | List currently connected terminals                   | Terminal directory with roles            |

Use **`mesh_send`** to notify or steer another terminal. Use **`mesh_prompt`** when you need the other terminal's answer back in the current tool result.

**If you need the other terminal's answer back here, use `mesh_prompt`, not `mesh_send`.**

### `mesh_send`

Send a fire-and-forget chat message to a specific terminal or broadcast to all.

| Parameter     | Type      | Description                                          |
| ------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `to`          | `string`  | Target terminal name, or `"*"` for broadcast         |
| `message`     | `string`  | Message content                                      |
| `triggerTurn` | `boolean` | If `true`, the receiver's LLM responds automatically |

When `triggerTurn` is enabled, the message is delivered via `pi.sendMessage` with `deliverAs: "steer"`, causing the remote agent to kick off an LLM turn.

**Returns:** send/delivery status only — **not** the recipient's LLM response. Even with `triggerTurn: true`, the remote terminal's reply stays on that terminal. Use `mesh_prompt` when you need the answer back.

> **Broadcast note:** Sending to `"*"` delivers to **all other terminals** — the sender is excluded.

The tool pre-validates the target name against the local terminal list before sending, catching typos early. On the hub, delivery confirmation is authoritative. On clients, delivery is optimistic — the message is sent to the hub for routing, and the hub handles errors via protocol-level responses.

### `mesh_prompt`

Send a prompt to a remote terminal and **wait** for the LLM's response (synchronous RPC pattern).

| Parameter | Type     | Description          |
| --------- | -------- | -------------------- |
| `to`      | `string` | Target terminal name |
| `prompt`  | `string` | Prompt text to send  |

**Returns:** the remote terminal's actual assistant reply text as the tool result.

- The remote terminal processes the prompt via `pi.sendUserMessage()` — as if a user typed it.
- **2-minute timeout**; supports abort signals.
- **Early failure detection** — if the message can't be delivered (e.g., target not found), the tool resolves immediately with an error instead of waiting for the timeout.
- Targets **one terminal at a time** (no broadcast mode).
- Only **one remote prompt** can execute at a time per target terminal. Concurrent requests are rejected with `"Terminal is busy"`.

### `mesh_list`

Lists all connected terminals with role info and self-identification. Takes no parameters.

**Example output:**

```
Connected terminals:
  • pi-1 (you)
  • pi-2
  • pi-3
```

## Slash Commands

| Command                 | Purpose                                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/mesh`                 | Show mesh status (name, role, online count)                                                  |
| `/mesh-name [name]`     | Rename this terminal. With no argument, adopts the current Pi session name if available. Collision-safe. |
| `/mesh-broadcast <msg>` | Broadcast a chat message to all other terminals                                              |
| `/mesh-connect`         | Reconnect to the mesh after a manual disconnect                                              |
| `/mesh-disconnect`      | Disconnect from the mesh and suppress auto-reconnect                                         |

### Examples

```
> /mesh
⚡ Mesh: "builder" (hub) · 3 online: builder, worker-1, worker-2

> /mesh-name orchestrator
✓ Renamed to "orchestrator"

> /mesh-name
✓ Renamed to "my-session"          (adopts Pi session name)

> /mesh-broadcast starting the build pipeline
✓ Broadcast sent

> /mesh-disconnect
✓ Disconnected from mesh

> /mesh-connect
✓ Joined mesh as "orchestrator" (3 online)
```

Auto-connect on startup is the default. `/mesh-disconnect` and `/mesh-connect` give you manual control over mesh participation without uninstalling the extension.

## Architecture

### Hub-Spoke Topology

Despite the name "mesh," the actual topology is **hub-spoke (star)**:

```
                       +-----------+
                       |    Hub    |
                       |   :9900   |
                       +-----+-----+
                             |
              +--------------+--------------+
              |              |              |
          +---+---+      +---+---+      +---+---+
          | pi-2  |      | pi-3  |      | pi-4  |
          |client |      |client |      |client |
          +-------+      +-------+      +-------+
```

- The **first terminal** to start becomes the **hub** — it runs a `WebSocketServer` on `127.0.0.1:9900`.
- **Subsequent terminals** connect as **clients** via plain WebSocket.
- All messages route **through the hub**; clients never talk directly to each other.

### Auto-Discovery Protocol

Startup follows a simple fallback sequence:

1. Attempt to connect as a **client** to `127.0.0.1:9900`.
2. If connection fails → become the **hub** (start a WebSocket server on that port).
3. If both fail (rare race condition) → retry after a randomized 2–5 second backoff.

### Hub Promotion

When the hub disconnects, clients detect the WebSocket close event, enter `"disconnected"` state, and call `scheduleReconnect()`. The **first terminal to retry** becomes the new hub via the same initialize-or-fallback flow.

There is **no explicit leader election** — promotion is race-based.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Port 9900 is already in use

If another process occupies port 9900, the terminal can't become the hub. It will attempt to connect as a client instead (which also fails if there's no real hub), then retry after 2–5 seconds. **The port is hardcoded** — there's no configuration to change it. You'll need to free the port or modify `DEFAULT_PORT` in `index.ts`.

### "Terminal is busy" rejections

Each terminal can only execute **one remote prompt at a time**. If a `mesh_prompt` arrives while the agent is already running (either from a local user or another remote prompt), it's immediately rejected with `"Terminal is busy"`. There is no queuing. Solutions:

- Wait for the target terminal to finish its current task.
- Spread prompts across multiple worker terminals.
- Have the sender retry after a delay.

### Terminals don't see each other

- Verify both terminals are on the same machine (the mesh only works on `127.0.0.1`).
- Run `/mesh` in each terminal to check status.
- Ensure port 9900 isn't blocked or occupied by a non-mesh process.

### Hub promotion loses state

When the hub goes down and a client promotes itself, terminal names and in-flight prompts from the old hub session are lost. All surviving clients reconnect and re-register. This is by design — see [Limitations](#limitations--design-decisions).

## Limitations & Design Decisions

| #   | Decision                                  | Rationale / Impact                                                                                                                                            |
| --- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **No authentication**                     | Any localhost process can connect to port 9900. Acceptable for local dev; don't expose the port externally.                                                   |
| 2   | **Hardcoded port (9900)**                 | Not configurable without editing `DEFAULT_PORT` in `index.ts`. Could conflict with other services on the same port.                                           |
| 3   | **Race-based hub promotion**              | Non-deterministic. Terminal state (names, in-flight prompts) is lost during promotion. Simple but imperfect.                                                  |
| 4   | **Single remote prompt per terminal**     | No queuing — immediate rejection if the target is busy. Keeps the model simple and avoids unbounded backlogs.                                                 |
| 5   | **No message persistence**                | Purely ephemeral WebSocket frames. Messages are lost if the recipient is offline.                                                                             |
| 6   | **Client rename triggers full reconnect** | Changing a client's name requires a new `register` message, so the client disconnects and reconnects. Hub renames are handled in-place with collision checks. |

## Internals

> This section covers implementation details for contributors and developers who want to understand or modify the extension's internals.

### Protocol

The wire protocol consists of **8 message types**, all serialized as JSON over WebSocket frames:

| Type              | Direction     | Purpose                                               |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `register`        | Client → Hub  | First message after connecting; requests a name       |
| `welcome`         | Hub → Client  | Confirms assigned name (deduplicated) + terminal list |
| `terminal_joined` | Hub → All     | Broadcast when a terminal joins                       |
| `terminal_left`   | Hub → All     | Broadcast when a terminal disconnects                 |
| `chat`            | Any → Any/All | Fire-and-forget message; optionally triggers LLM turn |
| `prompt_request`  | Any → Any     | Request a remote terminal to execute a prompt         |
| `prompt_response` | Any → Any     | Response carrying the remote prompt result            |
| `error`           | Hub → Client  | Error notification                                    |

### Message Flow Examples

**Joining the mesh:**

```
Client                         Hub
  |                             |
  | register {name:"builder"}   |
  |---------------------------->|
  |                             |
  | welcome {name:"builder",    |
  | terminals:["pi-1"]}         |
  |<----------------------------|
  |                             |
```

Hub then broadcasts `terminal_joined` to the other connected terminals.

**Sending a chat message:**

```
Client A            Hub              Client B
  |                  |                  |
  | chat {to:pi-2}   |                  |
  |----------------->|                  |
  |                  | chat {from:A}    |
  |                  |----------------->|
  |                  |                  |
```

**Remote prompt (synchronous RPC):**

```
Client A            Hub              Client B
  |                  |                  |
  | prompt_request   |                  |
  |----------------->|                  |
  |                  | prompt_request   |
  |                  |----------------->|
  |                  |   (LLM runs)     |
  |                  |<-----------------|
  | prompt_response  |                  |
  |<-----------------|                  |
```

### Name Uniqueness

The hub enforces unique terminal names via a `uniqueName()` function. If `"builder"` is already taken, the next terminal requesting that name is assigned `"builder-2"`, then `"builder-3"`, and so on.

Default names are random 4-character hex IDs: `t-a1b2`, `t-c3d4`, etc.

**Rename guards:**

- If you're already using the requested name, `/mesh-name` returns early (`"Already using..."`).
- On the hub, renaming checks if the name is taken by another connected client before accepting the change.
- On a client, the rename triggers a reconnect; the hub enforces uniqueness during re-registration and may assign a different name if taken.

**Unregistered client guard:** The hub ignores all non-`register` messages from clients that haven't completed registration, preventing protocol violations from malformed or out-of-order messages.

### State Management

| State Field              | Type                                    | Purpose                                                        |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `role`                   | `"hub" \| "client" \| "disconnected"`   | Current network role                                           |
| `isAgentBusy`            | `boolean`                               | Prevents accepting remote prompts during agent runs            |
| `manuallyDisconnected`   | `boolean`                               | Set by `/mesh-disconnect`; suppresses auto-reconnect           |
| `pendingRemotePrompt`    | `object \| null`                        | Tracks the single in-flight remote prompt execution            |
| `pendingPromptResponses` | `Map`                                   | Outstanding prompt RPCs awaiting responses                     |

### Message Routing & Error Handling

`routeMessage()` returns a `boolean` indicating delivery status:

- **Hub** — delivery is authoritative. If the target terminal isn't connected, the hub sends a protocol-level error back to the sender. For `prompt_request` messages to unknown targets, the hub sends a `prompt_response` with an error field so the sender's pending promise resolves immediately rather than timing out.
- **Client** — delivery is optimistic (`true` means "sent to hub"). The hub handles routing and errors via the protocol.

### Connection Lifecycle

Internally, teardown is split into two functions:

- **`disconnect()`** — closes sockets, clears connection state, resolves pending promises. Used by `/mesh-disconnect` and called internally by `cleanup()`.
- **`cleanup()`** — calls `disconnect()` then marks the extension as disposed. Used on `session_shutdown`.

The `manuallyDisconnected` flag distinguishes user-initiated disconnects (`/mesh-disconnect`) from connection loss. When set, `scheduleReconnect()` is suppressed — the terminal stays offline until `/mesh-connect` is explicitly called.

### Agent Lifecycle Integration

The extension hooks into Pi's agent lifecycle events:

- **`agent_start`** → Sets `isAgentBusy = true`, blocking incoming remote prompts.
- **`agent_end`** → Checks if a remote prompt was running. If so, extracts the last assistant response from `event.messages` and sends back a `prompt_response`.
- **`session_shutdown`** → Full cleanup via `cleanup()`: closes all sockets, resolves pending promises, and disposes the extension.

### Custom Message Renderer

Incoming mesh chat messages render with a styled prefix using the theme's accent color:

```
⚡ [pi-2] Here's the analysis you requested...
```

### Status Bar

The mesh status text in Pi's footer uses `theme.fg("dim", ...)` to match Pi's standard footer styling (gray, non-intrusive).
